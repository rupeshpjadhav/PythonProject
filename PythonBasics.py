# 1. Variables and data types
# name = "Alice"  # String
# age = 25        # Integer
# height = 5.6    # Float
# is_student = True  # Boolean
# #print(type(age))
#
# print(name)
# print(age)
# print(height)
# print(is_student)

# 2. Basic Operations
# Arithmetic operations
# a = 10
# b = 3
# print(a + b)  # Addition
# print(a - b)  # Subtraction
# print(a * b)  # Multiplication
# print(a / b)  # Division
# print(a % b)  # Modulus (remainder)

# Logical operations  allow us to combine or modify these truth values
# x = True
# y = False
# print(x and y)  # Logical AND #fale
# print(x or y)   # Logical OR  #true
# print(not x)    # Logical NOT #false

# 3.Input and Output
# #input() is used to take user input.
# name = input("Enter your name")
# print(name)
#
# #converting input to other datatypes
# #take integer input from user
# age = int(input("Enter your age:"))
# print(age)
#
# #converting input to float
# height = float(input("Enter height:"))
# print(height)

# output formating using f-string - place variables inside curly braces{} prefixed by f

name = "John"
age = 30
height = 5.9

# Name:John, Age:30, Height:5.9 ft
print(f"Name:{name},Age:{age},Height:{height} ft")

# The input() function lets you take input as a string.
# To convert the input to a number, use int() or float().
# The f-string syntax makes it easy to format strings and include variables."

# comment and code readabitly - comments are ignore by Python when running your code

# Use # for single-line comments.
# Use triple quotes (''' or """) for multi-line comments

# this is single line comment
"""this is multiline comment
second line
it can span multiple line"""

# Naming convention
# variables and function - use snake_case
# example user_name, calculate_total
# constants-UPPER_SNAKE_CASE EX: MAX_LIMIT, PI, GRAVITY
# Classes- CamelCase Ex: StudentProfile
